## Developing
### Preparations
- [Install Linux dependencies](docs/linux.md) if you are developing on Linux
- Make sure you are running NodeJS v10. Versions above will throw an errow when trying to install due to an [old fsevent dependency](https://github.com/fsevents/fsevents/issues/278)

### Setup
1. Fix native modules to match current electron node version
    ```
    npm run rebuild
    ```
2. Install dependencies using lerna
    ```
    npx lerna bootstrap
    ```
3. Run Ferdi Development App
    Run these two commands *simultaneously* in different console tabs.
    ```
    npm run dev
    npm run start
    ```

## Releases

You can find the binaries for Linux, MacOS and Windows in the [latest release](https://github.com/kytwb/Ferdi/releases/tag/Ferdi-5.2.0-beta.3) assets.
